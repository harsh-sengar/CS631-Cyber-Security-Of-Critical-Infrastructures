Anomaly Detection for Cyber Physical System using Machine Learning

# Description

Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is collection of networking, computation and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, with feedback loops where physical processes influence computations and vice versa. We cannot underestimate security of these critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS) as affects of any cyber attack is not limited to only financial loss these days. Attacks on critical infrastructures can take human life on stake as well such as attack on nuclear gas plant or chemical plants. We cannot ignore some of past notorious attacks i.e. Stuxnet, Triton , the Maroochy water breach and many more. Because of the great rewards that the attack on ICS, these frameworks are becoming appealing
focuses for attackers.
